**note**: this currently does not ship precompiled binaries so it will only work if you clone and integrate as a local Swift package and build the binaries for the `RustXcframework.xcframework`

## TODOs

* build async API (not supported by swift-bridge yet)
* support subscriptions
* support restoring purchases of non-consumables
* listen to transactions
